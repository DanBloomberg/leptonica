 *
 *  Each of the other seven can be derived from state 0 by applying some
 *  combination of a 90 degree clockwise rotation, a flip about
 *  a horizontal line, and a flip about a vertical line,
 *  all abbreviated as:
 *      R = Rotation (about a line perpendicular to the image)
 *      H = Horizontal flip (about a vertical line in the plane of the image)
 *      V = Vertical flip (about a horizontal line in the plane of the image)
 *
 *  We get these transformations:
 *      RHV
 *      000  -> 0
 *      001  -> 1
 *      010  -> 2
 *      011  -> 3
 *      100  -> 4
 *      101  -> 5
 *      110  -> 6
 *      111  -> 7
 *
 *  Note that in four of these, the sum of H and V is 1 (odd).
 *  For these four, we have a change in parity (handedness) of
 *  the image, and the transformation cannot be performed by
 *  rotation about a vertical line out of the page.   Under
 *  rotation R, the set of 8 transformations decomposes into
 *  two subgroups linking {0, 3, 4, 7} and {1, 2, 5, 6} independently.
 *
 *  pixOrientDetect() tests for a pure rotation (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees).
 *  It doesn't change parity.
 *
 *  pixMirrorDetect() tests for a horizontal flip about the vertical axis.
 *  It changes parity.
 *
 *  The landscape/portrait rotation can be detected in two ways:
 *
 *    (1) Compute the deskew confidence for an image segment,
 *        both as is and rotated 90 degrees  (see skew.c).
 *
 *    (2) Compute the ascender/descender signal for the image,
 *        both as is and rotated 90 degrees  (implemented here).
 *
 *  The ascender/descender signal is useful for determining text
 *  orientation in Roman alphabets because the incidence of letters
 *  with straight-line ascenders (b, d, h, k, l, 't') outnumber
 *  those with descenders ('g', p, q).  The letters 't' and 'g'
 *  will respond variably to the filter, depending on the type face.
 *
 *  What about the mirror image situations?  These aren't common
 *  unless you're dealing with film, for example.
 *  But you can reliably test if the image has undergone a
 *  parity-changing flip once about some axis in the plane
 *  of the image, using pixMirrorDetect*().  This works ostensibly by
 *  counting the number of characters with ascenders that
 *  stick out to the left and right of the ascender.  Characters
 *  that are not mirror flipped are more likely to extend to the
 *  right (b, h, k) than to the left (d).  Of course, that is for
 *  text that is rightside-up.  So before you apply the mirror
 *  test, it is necessary to insure that the text has the ascenders
 *  going up, and not down or to the left or right.  But here's
 *  what *really* happens.  It turns out that the pre-filtering before
 *  the hit-miss transform (HMT) is crucial, and surprisingly, when
 *  the pre-filtering is chosen to generate a large signal, the majority
 *  of the signal comes from open regions of common lower-case
 *  letters such as 'e', 'c' and 'f'.
 *
 *  The set of operations you actually use depends on your prior knowledge:
 *
 *  (1) If the page is known to be either rightside-up or upside-down, use
 *      either pixOrientDetect() with pleftconf = NULL, or
 *      pixUpDownDetect().
 *
 *  (2) If any of the four orientations are possible, use pixOrientDetect().
 *
 *  (3) If the text is horizontal and rightside-up, the only remaining
 *      degree of freedom is a left-right mirror flip: use pixMirrorDetect().
 *
 *  (4) If you have a relatively large amount of numbers on the page,
 *      use the slower pixUpDownDetect().
 *
 *  We summarize the full orientation and mirror flip detection process:
 *
 *  (1) First determine which of the four 90 degree rotations
 *      causes the text to be rightside-up.  This can be done
 *      with either skew confidence or the pixOrientDetect()
 *      signals.  For the latter, see the table for pixOrientDetect().
 *
 *  (2) Then, with ascenders pointing up, apply pixMirrorDetect().
 *      In the normal situation the confidence confidence will be
 *      large and positive.  However, if mirror flipped, the
 *      confidence will be large and negative.
 *
 *  A high-level interface, pixOrientCorrect() combines the detection
 *  of the orientation with the rotation decision and the rotation itself.
 *
 *  The structuring elements used for text orientation detection require text
 *  with ascenders and descenders.  They have been designed to work best
 *  with normal sized text (about 10 pt font), scanned with a resolution
 *  between 150 and 300 ppi.
 *
 *  For pedagogical reasons, we have included a dwa implementation of
 *  this functionality, in flipdetectdwa.c.notused.  It shows by example
 *  how to make a dwa implementation of an application that uses binary
 *  morphological operations.  It is faster than the rasterop implementation,
 *  but not by a large amount.
 *
 *  The generation of flipdetectdwa.c.notused was achieved as follows:
 *  (1) The program flipselgen.c.notused generates the DWA code, in two C files
 *  (2) The low-level DWA code in those two files was put into a single
 *      file, fliphmtgen.c.notused, for clarity.  We didn't want the two
 *      files (fmorphgen.3.c and fmorphgenlow.3.c) sitting around and
 *      possibly causing confusion.
 *  (3) This low-level code was directly incorporated into flipdetectdwa.c,
 *      where it substitutes for the basic rasterop code in flipdetect.c.
 *
 *  Finally, use can be made of programs such as exiftool and convert to
 *  read exif camera orientation data in jpeg files and conditionally rotate.
 *  Here is an example shell script, made by Dan9er:
 *  ==================================================================
 *  #!/bin/sh
 *  #   orientByExif.sh
 *  #   Dependencies: exiftool (exiflib) and convert (ImageMagick)
 *  #   Note: if there is no exif orientation data in the jpeg file,
 *  #         this simply copies the input file.
 *  #
 *  if [[ -z $(command -v exiftool) || -z $(command -v convert) ]]; then
 *      echo "You need to install dependencies; e.g.:"
 *      echo "   sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl"
 *      echo "   sudo apt install imagemagick"
 *      exit 1
 *  fi
 *  if [[ $# != 2 ]]; then
 *      echo "Syntax: orientByExif infile outfile"
 *      exit 2
 *  fi
 *  if [[ ${1: -4} != ".jpg" ]]; then
 *      echo "File is not a jpeg"
 *      exit 3
 *  fi
 *  if [[ $(exiftool -s3 -n -Orientation "$1") = 1 ]]; then
 *      echo "Image is already upright"
 *      exit 0

 *      (2) upconf is the normalized difference between up ascenders
 *          and down ascenders.  The image is analyzed without rotation
 *          for being rightside-up or upside-down.  Set &upconf to null
 *          to skip this operation.
 *      (3) leftconf is the normalized difference between up ascenders
 *          and down ascenders in the image after it has been
 *          rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  With that rotation, ascenders
 *          projecting to the left in the source image will project up
 *          in the rotated image.  We compute this by rotating 90 degrees
 *          clockwise and testing for up and down ascenders.  Set
 *          &leftconf to null to skip this operation.
 *      (4) Note that upconf and leftconf are not linear measures of
 *          confidence, e.g., in a range between 0 and 100.  They
 *          measure how far you are out on the tail of a (presumably)
 *          normal distribution.  For example, a confidence of 10 means
 *          that it is nearly certain that the difference did not
 *          happen at random.  However, these values must be interpreted
 *          cautiously, taking into consideration the estimated prior
 *          for a particular orientation or mirror flip.   The up-down
 *          signal is very strong if applied to text with ascenders
 *          up and down, and relatively weak for text at 90 degrees,
 *          but even at 90 degrees, the difference can look significant.
 *          For example, suppose the ascenders are oriented horizontally,
 *          but the test is done vertically.  Then upconf can
 *          be < -MIN_CONF_FOR_UP_DOWN, suggesting the text may be
 *          upside-down.  However, if instead the test were done
 *          horizontally, leftconf will be very much larger
 *          (in absolute value), giving the correct orientation.
 *      (5) If you compute both upconf and leftconf, and there is
 *          sufficient signal, the following table determines the
 *          cw angle necessary to rotate pixs so that the text is
 *          rightside-up:
 *             0 deg :           upconf >> 1,    abs(upconf) >> abs(leftconf)
 *             90 deg :          leftconf >> 1,  abs(leftconf) >> abs(upconf)
 *             180 deg :         upconf << -1,   abs(upconf) >> abs(leftconf)
 *             270 deg :         leftconf << -1, abs(leftconf) >> abs(upconf)
 *      (6) One should probably not interpret the direction unless
 *          there are a sufficient number of counts for both orientations,
 *          in which case neither upconf nor leftconf will be 0.0.
 *      (7) Use on text images with a resolution between 150 and 300 ppi.
 *      (8) This algorithm will fail on some images, such as tables,
 *          where most of the characters are numbers and appear as
 *          uppercase, but there are some repeated words that give a
 *          biased signal.  It may be advisable to run a table detector
 *          first (e.g., pixDecideIfTable()), and not run the orientation
 *          detector if it is a table.

 * \return  0 if OK, 1 on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) See pixOrientDetect() for other details.
 *      (2) The detected confidence %conf is the normalized difference
 *          between the number of detected up and down ascenders,
 *          assuming that the text is either rightside-up or upside-down
 *          and not rotated at a 90 degree angle.
 *      (3) The typical mode of operation is %npixels == 0.
 *          If %npixels > 0, this removes HMT matches at the
 *          beginning and ending of "words."  This is useful for
 *          pages that may have mostly digits, because if npixels == 0,
 *          leading "1" and "3" digits can register as having
 *          ascenders or descenders, and "7" digits can match descenders.
 *          Consequently, a page image of only digits may register
 *          as being upside-down.
 *      (4) We want to count the number of instances found using the HMT.
 *          An expensive way to do this would be to count the
 *          number of connected components.  A cheap way is to do a rank
 *          reduction cascade that reduces each component to a single
 *          pixel, and results (after two or three 2x reductions)
 *          in one pixel for each of the original components.
 *          After the reduction, you have a much smaller pix over
 *          which to count pixels.  We do only 2 reductions, because
 *          this function is designed to work for input pix between
 *          150 and 300 ppi, and an 8x reduction on a 150 ppi image
 *          is going too far -- components will get merged.
 *      (5) Use on text images with a resolution between 150 and 300 ppi.

 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) For this test, it is necessary that the text is horizontally
 *          oriented, with ascenders going up.
 *      (2) conf is the normalized difference between the number of
 *          right and left facing characters with ascenders.
 *          Left-facing are {d}; right-facing are {b, h, k}.
 *          At least that was the expectation.  In practice, we can
 *          really just say that it is the normalized difference in
 *          hits using two specific hit-miss filters, textsel1 and textsel2,
 *          after the image has been suitably pre-filtered so that
 *          these filters are effective.  See (4) for what's really happening.
 *      (3) A large positive conf value indicates normal text, whereas
 *          a large negative conf value means the page is mirror reversed.
 *      (4) The implementation is a bit tricky.  The general idea is
 *          to fill the x-height part of characters, but not the space
 *          between them, before doing the HMT.  This is done by
 *          finding pixels added using two different operations -- a
 *          horizontal close and a vertical dilation -- and adding
 *          the intersection of these sets to the original.  It turns
 *          out that the original intuition about the signal was largely
 *          in error: much of the signal for right-facing characters
 *          comes from the lower part of common x-height characters, like
 *          the e and c, that remain open after these operations.
 *          So it's important that the operations to close the x-height
 *          parts of the characters are purposely weakened sufficiently
 *          to allow these characters to remain open.  The wonders
 *          of morphology!
 *      (5) Use on text images with a resolution between 150 and 300 ppi.
