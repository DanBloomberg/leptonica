 *    scale_it filein scalex scaley fileout lossless [sharpen antialias togray]
 *
 *    where
 *         scalex:    floating pt input
 *         scaley:    ditto
 *         lossless:  (for bpp >= 8) 1 to output jpeg; 0 to output png
 *         sharpen :  (for bpp > 1; scale factor in [0.2 ... 1.4]):
 *                    1 to sharpen; 0 not to sharpen
 *         antialias: (for bpp > 1): 1 to use area-mapping or linear
 *                    interpolation; 0 for sampling.
 *         togray:    (for bpp == 1, reduction): 1 for scale-to-gray;
 *                    0 for sampling
 *
 *    The choice of writing lossless (png) or lossy (jpeg) only applies
 *    for bpp >= 8.  Otherwise:
 *          bpp == 1 -->  tiffg4
 *          bpp == 2 -->  png
 *          bpp == 4 -->  png
 *
 *    Sharpening: no sharpening is done for scale factors < 0.2 or > 1.4.
 *    Sharpening increases the saliency of edges, making the scaled image
 *    look less fuzzy.  It is much slower than scaling without sharpening.
 *    The default is to sharpen.
 *
 *    Antialias: area-mapping and linear interpolation give higher
 *    quality results with bpp > 1.  Sampling is faster, but shows
 *    artifacts, such as pixel-sized steps in lines.  The default is
 *    to use antialiasing.
 *
 *    ScaleToGray: for bpp == 1, downscaling to gray gives a better appearance
 *    than subsampling.  The default is to scale-to-gray.
 *
 *    The defaults are all intended to improve the quality of the result.
 *    The quality can be degraded, with faster processing, by setting
 *    some of the three optional inputs to 0.
 *
 *    Note that the short form:
 *        scale_it filein scalex scaley fileout lossless
 *    is equivalent to
 *        scale_it filein scalex scaley fileout lossless 1 1 1
