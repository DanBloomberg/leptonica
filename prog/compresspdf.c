/*
 * compresspdf.c
 *
 *    This program concatenates all pdfs in a directory by rendering them
 *    as images, optionally scaling the images, and generating an output pdf.
 *    The pdfs are taken in lexical order.  Pages are encoded with either
 *    tiffg4 or jpeg (DCT), or a mixture of them depending on input parameters
 *    and page color content.  For DCT encoding, the jpeg quality factor
 *    can be used to trade off the size of the resulting pdf against
 *    the image quality.
 *
 *    If the pages are monochrome (black and white), use of the %onebit
 *    flag will achieve better compression with less distortion.
 *    If most of the pages are black and white, but some have color that
 *    needs to be saved, input parameters %onebit and %savecolor should
 *    be both set to 1.  Then the pages with color are compressed with DCT
 *    and the monochrome pages are compressed with tiffg4.
 *
 *    If the images in the pdf are low-resolution grayscale, they can be
 *    upscaled 2x and binarized to make a readable and better compressed pdf.
 *    For example, an Internet Archive book pdf with 8 bpp images at a
 *    resolution of about 120 ppi, can be converted to 240 ppi, 1 bpp with
 *    a size reduction of about 40%.  For that, use: %onebit = 1,
 *    savecolor = 1 (if there are color images), scalefactor = 2.0.
 *
 *      Syntax:
 *       compresspdf basedir imres scalefactor onebit savecolor
 *                   quality title fileout
 *
 *    The %basedir is a directory where the input pdf files are located.
 *    The program will operate on every file in this directory with
 *    the ".pdf" extension.
 *
 *    The %imres is the desired resolution of the rasterization from the
 *    pdf page to a page image.  Two choices are allowed: 150 and 300 ppi.
 *    Use 0 for default (150 ppi).  The actual resolution used by the
 *    renderer depends on the page image size and is computed internally.
 *    We limit the maximum resolution to 300 ppi because these images are
 *    RGB uncompressed and are large: 6.3 MB for 150 ppi and 25 MB for 300 ppi.
 *
 *    The %scalefactor is typically used to downscale the image to
 *    reduce the size of the generated pdf.  It should not affect the
 *    pdf display otherwise.  The maximum allowed value is 2.0.
 *    For normal text on images scanned at 300 ppi, a 2x reduction
 *    (%scalefactor = 0.5) may be satisfactory.  We compute an output
 *    resolution for that pdf that will cause it to print 11 inches high,
 *    based on the height in pixels of the first image in the set.
 *
 *    Images are saved in the ./image directory as RGB in ppm format.
 *    If the %onebit flag is 0, these will be encoded in the output pdf
 *    using DCT.  To force the images to be 1 bpp, with tiffg4 encoding, set
 *    the $onebit flag to 1.
 *
 *    The %savecolor flag is ignored unless %onebit is 1.  In that case,
 *    if %savecolor is 1, the image is tested for color content, and if
 *    even a relatively small amount is found, the image will be encoded
 *    with DCT instead of tiffg4.
 *
 *    The %quality is the jpeg output quality factor for images stored
 *    in the pdf.  Use 0 for the default value (50), which is satisfactory
 *    for many purposes.  Use 75 for standard jpeq quality; 85-95 are very
 *    high quality.  Allowed values are between 25 and 95.
 *
 *    The %title is the title given to the pdf.  Use %title == "none"
 *    to omit the title.
 *
 *    The pdf output is written to %fileout.  It is advisable (but not
 *    required) to have a '.pdf' extension.
 *
 *    As the first step in processing, images are saved in the directory
 *    /tmp/lept/renderpdf/, as RGB at either 150 or 300 ppi in ppm format.
 *    Each image about 6MB at 150 ppi, or 25MB at 300 ppi.
 *
 *    We use pdftoppm to render the images at (typically) 150 pixels/inch
 *    for a full page, when scalefactor = 1.0.  The renderer uses the
 *    mediaboxes to decide how big to make the images.  If those boxes
 *    have values that are too large, the intermediate ppm images can
 *    be very large.  To prevent that, we compute the resolution to input
 *    to pdftoppm that results in RGB ppm images representing page images
 *    at about 150 ppi (when scalefactor = 1.0).  These images are about
 *    6MB, but are written quickly because there is no compression.
 *
 *    N.B.  This requires running pdftoppm from the Poppler package
 *          of pdf utilities  For non-unix systems, this requires
 *          installation of the cygwin Poppler package:
 *       https://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-cat.cgi?file=x86/poppler/
 *              poppler-0.26.5-1
